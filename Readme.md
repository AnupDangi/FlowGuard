I am buliding Event-Driven Data Engineering Platform for Real-Time Decisions for Zomato Platform.

This architecture might change in the next upcoming weeks.
But for the week 1 this is the template.

Week2: Learning all unkown the tools and making sure the architecture can be enhanced for betterment.

Week3: I will start implementing with dummy kafka logs,then move to data engineering pipeline and try to complete it by week4.Then 2 days build frontend and backend using AI basic crud routes,might not take more and integrate.
Then do unit testing in last few days.
